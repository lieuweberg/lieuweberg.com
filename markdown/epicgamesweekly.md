### Getting started

If you want the weekly embed sent to a channel automatically;
1. Invite the bot using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=777612933643108392&scope=bot&permissions=150528) or the invite button above.
2. Navigate to the channel in your server where you want the bot to send the weekly free games embed.
3. Type `egw set here`. Alternatively you can also use `egw set #channel` to set the channel without being inside it.

If you just want to view the weekly free games manually, you can run `egw weekly`.
